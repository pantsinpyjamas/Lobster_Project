# Lobster_Project
This is a collection of R code that I've written for my biometrics class. 
The big project for the class is to use our own data (or some provided by the prof) to answer a question/hypothesis.
I decided to generate my own data, modelled after what I will collect this field season, since I don't have my own data yet.
I'm including the R code I used to generate my data, how I made my figures, and the analysis I've conducted.

# Background


# Objectives
1. Quantify settlement of post larval American lobster in the southwestern Bay of Fundy (sw BoF).
2. Model proportional settlement abundance at depth considering the area of seafloor with cobble-substrate at different depths in the sw BoF.
3. Develop a model that best relates temperature to variability in settlement density using different temperature metrics for my study year.
